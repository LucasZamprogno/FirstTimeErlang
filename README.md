I don't really remember much of this one unfortunately, but it was my first time using Erlang, or a purely functional language at all. 
It was more rough because the underlying content (this was a parallelism course) of the problem was also new to me.
Kind of liked using it in the end. It was a bit rough to get going with but once it was finished and compile it just kind of worked.
Pattern matching method signatures is very cool.
